Karaoke transcription job
=========================

What's in this repository
-------------------------

This repository contains the songs for the transcription job.

For each song you'll find:

* A normal version
* A version with only vocals
* A version with no vocals
* The song text

What needs to be done
---------------------

For each song you'll need to generate a txt file with the lyrics, notes and timestamps.
There's an example in the repository, in the folder `Guardo Gli Asini che volano UltraStar TXT`.

Ultrastar play can probably be used to create a txt file.
I'm not sure if it's the best software for the job.
Figuring out what software to use is part of the job.
